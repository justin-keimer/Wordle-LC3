# LC-3 Wordle Game

This is a simplified **Wordle-style word guessing game** implemented in **LC-3 Assembly language**. The user has 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter secret word. After each guess, the program provides feedback using the classic Wordle color indicators:

- **G** for Green: correct letter in the correct position
- **Y** for Yellow: correct letter in the wrong position
- **B** for Black: incorrect letter (not in the word)

## ðŸ“‹ Program Requirements

- **LC-3 Simulator**: The program must be assembled and run in a simulator that supports the `.STRINGZ`, `.BLKW`, and standard TRAP routines (`GETC`, `OUT`, `PUTS`, etc.).
- **Text-based Input**: Enter your guess using lowercase or uppercase letters. The program converts lowercase letters to uppercase automatically.
- **Display**: Since the program runs in a console environment, no special graphics resolution is required â€” just make sure the console window is large enough to view multiline text output.
